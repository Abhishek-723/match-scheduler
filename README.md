# This project contains 2 routes , that are '/' and '/matches'

  In the matches route there is list of the matches already scheduled.
  
  
  In the / route there is a multipage form, first of all you need to input the type of the match, then on the next form you have to enter the details of the match like dates, location, tournament name, etc. Then in the following page you get to select the details regarding the team name and home/away match. All these values are set in the states and after the final form you need to submit the form and the details gets saved to the global store using redux.
